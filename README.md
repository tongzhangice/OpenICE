OpenIce is a project for simulating ice flow of alpine glaciers and ice sheets in polar regions, Antarctica and Greenland. Glaciers and ice sheets are key components in the cryosphere and have great impacts on the freshwater resources, sea level rise and climate system. By OpenICE, we hope to find a numerical solution than can be applied in simulations of both single glacier dynamics and regional glacier changes. By OpenICE, we hope to bring more public attention to glaciology.
